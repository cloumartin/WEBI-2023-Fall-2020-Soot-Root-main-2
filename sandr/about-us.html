        <h2 class="display-4">Plants Make People Happy</h2>
        <p>This simple idea was the seed for what would become The Sill: a modern plant destination for the modern plant lover.Plants make us happier, healthier, more efficient and boost our creativity. They even clean the air we breathe. But all our modern city-living has us indoors a lot. So we thought: why not bring the outdoors in? We think everyone deserves to have their own personal plant oasis.And, we think finding your new plant should be easy.</p>

        <p>
            Take it from us, the plant category is difficult to navigate, especially as our shopping behaviors and expectations evolve. Our solution? Take the best parts of grandma’s garden supply center (the plants) and create a seamless shopping experience (without getting your hands too dirty).

            The Sill started exclusively online, delivering potted houseplants like pizza to doorsteps all over the U.S.A. In New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco, our brick and mortar stores offer an escape from the concrete jungle, where we put our plants on display year-round and host weekly workshops. It’s quickly becoming everyone’s happy place.

            Every plant from Soot & Root comes with care information and the support of our team of knowledgable plant parents. Our goal is to make the experience of being a plant parent as wonderful as the plants themselves. We’re here to inspire confidence in the next generation of plant parents.

        <h2 class="display-4">5 Plant Care Tips</h2>
<p>1.​ ​Choose Plants Based on Light in your Space
    Are the plants you love the ones you can have? The​ available light in your space will help you decide. Check the direction your windows are facing; south-facing windows give bright light, east/west-facing windows give moderate light and north-facing windows give low light. Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect sunlight.

    If the sun is intense through your windows, add a lovely sheer curtain to diffuse the light. Cacti and some succulents like aloe can of course handle brighter, direct sunlight. You don’t want to overexpose or underexpose any plant. They need the right amount of light to live.
</p>
        <p>2.​ Figure Out Your Plant Compatibility
            New to plant parenthood? A busy ​work schedule, social​ ​life and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect. It’s okay. Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle. A jetsetter like yourself will enjoy the resilience of low-maintenance succulents, ZZ plants or snake plants, all pretty low key, as long as they have enough light (bright and low light respectively). These should keep looking their best when you return from your next trip.

            If you’ve got more time, you can try a few attention-loving air plants, orchids or ferns. Like a mist for the face, an extra spritz of filtered water daily between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for these delicate plants.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>3.​ ​Less (Water) Is More
            It’s better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your water schedule and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it’s thing for now.

            How often you water will also change throughout the year. Plants need less water in the winter, when they’re growing slower, the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense. If the heat is on and the soil is drying quicker, they may need a bit more water. Wilting leaves or soil that looks pulled away from the sides of the planter are signs of a thirsty plant.

            Always use warm water because it absorbs best. Pour water directly on the soil around the base of the plant, because plants absorb water from their roots. The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air plants, who need water on their leaves as well.

            Place a saucer under your planter. When you water, let it soak in for a few hours, then toss any water that’s left on the saucer. If no water is left over, give the soil another soak.

        </p>
        <p></p>
<p>4.​ ​Raise the Humidity Levels
    Staying true to your plants natural environment will help your plant thrive indoors. Most tropical plants, ferns and orchids prefer high humidity and bright to moderate, indirect light. Mist these plants in between waterings with filtered water. During the dry months of winter, grouping similar plants together helps to create a more humid microclimate. A humidifier can help too and it’s great for humans. On the other hand, most desert dwellers, like cacti, prefer dry air and bright, direct light with no shade at all. They definitely don’t need to be misted and don’t care for humidity all that much.

</p>
        <p></p>
<p>5.​ ​A Note on Stability
    Keep​ ​your​ ​plant’s​ ​home environment as stable as possible. Extreme changes can stress plants out. Keep the temperature between 65 and 75 degrees F. Avoid placing your plants near radiators, A/C units and forced-air vents, which can create hot or cold drafts.</p>
